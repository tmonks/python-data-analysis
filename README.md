# Python Data Analysis Sandbox
This repository is a space where I will be taking notes and testing tools and techniques I'm learning about in Python data analysis.

The "fcc" notebooks were part of the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis in Python curriculum and were copied from the following repositories:

- [freecodecamp-intro-to-numpy](https://github.com/ine-rmotr-curriculum/freecodecamp-intro-to-numpy)
- [freecodecamp-intro-to-pandas](https://github.com/ine-rmotr-curriculum/freecodecamp-intro-to-pandas)
- [data-cleaning-rmotr-freecodecamp](https://github.com/ine-rmotr-curriculum/data-cleaning-rmotr-freecodecamp)
